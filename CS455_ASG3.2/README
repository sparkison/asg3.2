Census data collection using MapReduce, Shaun Parkison (shaunpa)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile jar via: "ant compile dist", "census.jar" file will be generated within the "dist" folder

Run using "$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar 'JAR_LOCATION/census.jar' cs455.util.CensusDriver [census_input_path] [results_output_path] [level (3,2, or 1)]"

[census_input_path] is the path that contains the census data
[results_output_path] is where the results will be stored
[level (3,2, or 1)] the level of data to process; 3 will run all needed jobs to determine answers. 2 will run only the MR job needed
to complete Q7 and Q8 based on the output from 3. 1 will run only the output formatting based on the outputs from 3 and 2 (NOTE: 1 depends on 2 depends on 3).

Results for Q1 will be in: 				[results_output_path]/part-r-00000
Results for Q2 will be in:				[results_output_path]/part-r-00001
Results for Q3(a, b and c) will be in:	[results_output_path]/part-r-00002
Results for Q4 will be in: 				[results_output_path]/part-r-00003
Results for Q5 will be in: 				[results_output_path]/part-r-00004
Results for Q6 will be in: 				[results_output_path]/part-r-00005
Input needed for Q7 and Q8 in: 			[results_output_path]/part-r-00006

Results for Q7 and Q8 will be in: 		[results_output_path]_2/part-r-00000

Q7 and Q8 calculations are done based on output from the first MR task (located at [results_output_path]/part-r-00006).

Finally, a file titled "Results" will be generated upon completion of the above MR jobs. 
This file is a compilation of the results that is produced based on the MR job outputs to be more human readable.

cs455
  |--job
  |	  |--CensusDataJob (the job configuration class for the MR job)
  |--map
  |   |--CensusMapper (primary map class, used for Q1 through Q6)
  	  |--SecondaryMapper (secondary map class, uses some outputs from CensusMapper to calculate answers to Q7 and Q8)
  |--partition
  |	  |--CensusPartitioner (primary partitioner; partitions the various questions to separate reduce tasks)
  |--reduce
  |	  |--CensusReducer (primary reducer class, used for Q1 through Q6)
  |	  |--SecondaryReducer (secondary reducer class, used to calculate final answers to Q7 and Q8)
  |--util
  |	  |--CensusDriver (the primary driver class. This is used to execute the MR tasks needed in succession to produce the final outputs)
  |	  |--RangeBuilder (a factory class, used to build String[] variables for the various ranges used)
